# Liquid Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/drampelt/compose-countdown/actions/workflows/Check.yaml/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
Liquid Timer is an Android app made with Jetpack Compose for quickly setting short countdown timers. It features an animated liquid visualization of the time remaining.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The interface was inspired by [this Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2909633--014-Daily-UI-Challenge-Countdown-Timer), but I added the liquid wave animation. It was surprisingly simple to implement!
